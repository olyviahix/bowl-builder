# Build A Bowl
Bowl Building App - Olyvia Hix

Build A Bowl is an app in progress that will allow a user to go to a site and add specific amounts of proteins, carbs, fats, veggies and toppings to a bowl and it will calculate the total Macros for you! This is a simple app for someone who is a fitness enthusiast and needs to track their intake, or for anyone who simply wants to track certain aspects of a meal. This app is in progress and will be able to have all of these functions in the future.
The full intention of this app is to build it so it can be added to an already functioning restaurant such as LeanFeast and/or Qdoba or any other business that has a "bowl building" meal. 
This app also pulls from an API that shows you the weather at the local LeanFeast location in Los Angeles CA at any given time. 

This project was built as a front-end, React.JS project. Routing and React skills were tested throughout. The technologies that were used in this project are are JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project is a front end only project, so when you refresh, you will lose what you have put into your options.

Some challenges that I faced during this project were calling from a Google Sheets API. I have the option to select the protein from a dropdown, and it will show up in the "right click, inspect" portion of the server. I am having a hard time displaying the selected Macro count on the screen. This part is a work in progress for the future.

Some favorite aspects of this project that I incorporated is the simple yet eye catching styling. 

I plan on working more to expand this project to have a log in as well as being able to incorporate this into a company that can use this on their own website.

# How To Run Build A Bowl

If working in VSCode, once downloaded the project, in any file right click and "Run With Live Server". This will start the app in the browser and run it live.

# How To Use Build A Bowl

While in the project, you will see a navigation bar with options to click on. The LeanFeast tab in the navbar will take you to a page that allows you to choose a protein (more options like fats, carbs, toppings, etc. to come) and it will pull from a google sheets API and display the Macro total count on the screen.
